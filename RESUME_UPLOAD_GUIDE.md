# Resume Upload Guide - Fix Application Failures

## 🔴 Current Issue

**Applications are failing** because users have NO resumes uploaded:
```
Resume: ✗ No resume
```

**Impact:** 18 failed applications, 0 successful

## ✅ Solution: Resume Upload API Already Available!

### API Endpoints:

#### 1. Upload Resume (Authenticated)
```bash
POST /api/v1/resumes/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Body:
- file: PDF file
```

#### 2. Upload Resume (Guest)
```bash
POST /api/v1/resumes/upload-guest
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- file: PDF file
- session_id: guest session ID
```

## 📋 Quick Test

### Upload Resume for Test User:

```bash
# Step 1: Get user ID
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users

# Step 2: Upload resume (guest mode - no auth needed)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/upload-guest?session_id=test_session" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/resume.pdf"
```

### Response:
```json
{
  "id": "resume_id_here",
  "filename": "resume.pdf",
  "status": "processing",
  "is_primary": true,
  "created_at": "2025-10-07T..."
}
```

## 🎯 Features Already Implemented

1. ✅ **Resume Upload** - PDF files
2. ✅ **Resume Parsing** - Extract text, skills, experience
3. ✅ **ATS Score** - Calculate compatibility score
4. ✅ **AI Enhancement** - Improve resume for ATS
5. ✅ **Storage** - S3/R2 cloud storage
6. ✅ **Background Processing** - Async parsing with retry

## 🔧 How Auto-Apply Uses Resumes

In `auto_apply_queue_worker.py:271`:
```python
# Get user's resume
resume_path = await self._get_user_resume(user["_id"], db)

# Apply via browser with resume
result = await browser_service.apply_to_job(
    job_url=job_url,
    resume_path=resume_path,  # ← Needs this!
    ...
)
```

**Without resume → Application fails!**

## 📊 Current System Status

### What's Working:
- ✅ Resume upload endpoint exists
- ✅ Resume parsing service exists
- ✅ Database schema ready
- ✅ Auto-apply code checks for resume

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Users haven't uploaded resumes
- ❌ Frontend upload form may be missing
- ❌ No sample resumes for testing

## 🚀 Next Steps to Enable Applications

### Option 1: Upload Test Resume (Quick Fix)

# Convert to PDF or use existing PDF

# Upload for test user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/upload-guest?session_id=test_user_123" \
  -F "file=@test_resume.pdf"
```

### Option 2: Frontend Integration
Add resume upload to frontend:
```typescript
// In user profile or onboarding
const uploadResume = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);

  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/resumes/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: formData
  });

  return response.json();
};
```

### Option 3: Use LinkedIn Bot (No Resume Needed)
LinkedIn AIHawk bot doesn't require local resume:
- Bot generates resume from profile data
- Works with LinkedIn Easy Apply
- Already integrated in code

## 🎓 Complete Resume Flow

```
1. User uploads resume PDF
   ↓
2. System stores in S3/R2
   ↓
3. Background parser extracts text
   ↓
4. AI parses skills, experience, etc.
   ↓
5. ATS score calculated
   ↓
6. Resume marked as "completed"
   ↓
7. Queue worker can now use resume
   ↓
8. Applications succeed! ✅
```

## 🔍 Check Resume Status

```bash
# Get all resumes for user
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Response:
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "filename": "resume.pdf",
    "status": "completed",
    "ats_score": 85,
    "ats_grade": "A",
    "is_primary": true,
    "parsed_data": {
      "skills": {"technical": ["Python", "React"]},
      "experience_years": 5
    }
  }
]
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Requirements:
- **Format:** PDF only (currently)
- **Size:** Reasonable (< 5MB recommended)
- **Content:** Should have clear text (not scanned image)

### Processing Time:
- Upload: Instant
- Parsing: 30-60 seconds (background)
- Status: Check `/api/v1/resumes/{id}` for completion

### Primary Resume:
- Only PRIMARY resume is used for auto-apply
- Set via: `POST /api/v1/resumes/{id}/set-primary`
- Last uploaded resume is automatically primary

## 🎯 Test Checklist

- [ ] Upload resume for test user
- [ ] Check resume status = "completed"
- [ ] Verify parsed_data has skills
- [ ] Confirm is_primary = true
- [ ] Re-run failed applications
- [ ] Monitor application success rate

## 📈 Expected Results After Fix

**Before:**
```
✗ No resume → Application fails
```

**After:**
```
✓ Resume uploaded → Auto-fill forms → Application succeeds!
```

**Success Rate Target:** 50-70% (with resume + proper forms)

---

**Status:** Resume system already implemented, just needs uploads
**Action:** Upload resumes for existing users via API
**Expected Fix Time:** 5 minutes per user
**Date:** October 7, 2025
