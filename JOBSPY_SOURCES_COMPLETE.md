## Recommended Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maximum Coverage (Safe)
```python
safe_platforms = ["indeed", "google", "bayt", "naukri"]
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=safe_platforms,
    search_term="your_search",
    location="your_location",
    results_wanted=50
)
```

### Strategy 2: USA Focus (Safest)
```python
usa_platforms = ["indeed", "google"]
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=usa_platforms,
    search_term="your_search",
    location="USA",
    results_wanted=100,
    country_indeed='USA'
)
```

### Strategy 3: Global (Risk Aware)
```python
# Separate calls to handle different risk levels
safe_jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=["indeed", "google"],
    results_wanted=100
)

# Try risky platforms with low volume
try:
    risky_jobs = scrape_jobs(
        site_name=["zip_recruiter"],
        results_wanted=10  # Keep low
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Blocked: {e}")  # Expected
```

## Implementation for ApplyRush.AI

### Update JobSpyScraperService:

```python
class JobSpyScraperService:
    # Safe platforms (no ToS violations)
    SAFE_PLATFORMS = ["indeed", "google"]

    # Regional platforms (try if needed)
    REGIONAL_PLATFORMS = {
        "middle_east": ["bayt"],
        "india": ["naukri"],
        "bangladesh": ["bdjobs"]
    }

    # Risky platforms (use sparingly)
    RISKY_PLATFORMS = ["zip_recruiter", "glassdoor"]

    # Banned platforms (never use)
    BANNED_PLATFORMS = ["linkedin"]
```

### Regional Support:

```python
async def scrape_by_region(self, region: str, search_params: dict):
    if region == "usa":
        sites = ["indeed", "google"]
    elif region == "middle_east":
        sites = ["bayt", "indeed", "google"]
    elif region == "india":
        sites = ["naukri", "indeed", "google"]
    elif region == "bangladesh":
        sites = ["bdjobs", "indeed"]
    else:
        sites = ["indeed", "google"]  # Default

    jobs = scrape_jobs(
        site_name=sites,
        **search_params
    )
```
