        during peak hours, affecting user experience. The query was joining multiple large tables

        I created composite indexes on transaction_date and user_id, then optimized the query logic
        to use window functions instead of subqueries. After testing in staging, I deployed during
        maintenance window. The query time dropped from 15 seconds to under 200ms, improving overall
